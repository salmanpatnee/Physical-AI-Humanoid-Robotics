Update the Docusaurus sidebar by removing all default items, including the tutorial introduction, core modules, and the application menu, ensuring that only the book’s custom structure remains. Replace the placeholder introduction content with an accurate introductory section tailored specifically for the “Teaching Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course” book. Reorganize the sidebar so that each module’s chapters are grouped under the correct module heading—for example, “Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)” containing its subtopics such as “Focus: Middleware for robot control” and “ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services.” The final sidebar must be clean, hierarchical, aligned with the book’s structure, and ready for content integration.
