# Specification Quality Checklist: Physical AI Humanoid Robotics Landing Page

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-05
**Last Updated**: 2025-12-05
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: PASSED ✓ (Updated for Physical AI Humanoid Robotics theme)

All validation checks have passed. The specification has been updated to reflect the Physical AI Humanoid Robotics book theme while maintaining the design structure from the original mockup. The spec is complete, clear, and ready for the next phase.

### Validation Details

**Content Quality**:
- ✓ Specification focuses on WHAT and WHY without HOW
- ✓ No technology stack, frameworks, or implementation patterns mentioned
- ✓ Language is accessible to business stakeholders and non-technical readers
- ✓ All three mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are comprehensive
- ✓ Successfully adapted content from "AI Native Software Development" to "Physical AI Humanoid Robotics" theme

**Requirement Completeness**:
- ✓ No clarification markers found - all requirements are specific and actionable for robotics context
- ✓ Each functional requirement states clear capabilities (20 FR items total, adapted for robotics)
- ✓ All success criteria are measurable with specific metrics (10 SC items)
- ✓ Success criteria avoid implementation terms and focus on user/business outcomes
- ✓ Six user stories with detailed acceptance scenarios (total of 17 scenarios) adapted for Physical AI context
- ✓ Six edge cases identified covering responsiveness, accessibility, and robotics-specific considerations
- ✓ Clear scope boundaries with Assumptions and Out of Scope sections updated for robotics
- ✓ Eight explicit assumptions documented (robotics-themed) and eleven out-of-scope items listed

**Feature Readiness**:
- ✓ All 20 functional requirements are directly traceable to user stories in robotics context
- ✓ User scenarios cover all major page sections with priorities (P1, P2, P3)
- ✓ Ten measurable success criteria align with functional requirements
- ✓ Specification maintains abstraction - describes desired outcomes for Physical AI content, not implementation approaches
- ✓ Content theme successfully pivoted from software development to robotics while preserving design structure

## Update History

**2025-12-05**: Updated specification to reflect Physical AI Humanoid Robotics book theme. Changes include:
- Updated hero section title from "AI Native Software Development" to "Physical AI Humanoid Robotics"
- Adapted development spectrum to robotics context (Traditional → AI-Enhanced → Physical AI paradigms)
- Updated maturity levels to reflect robotics implementation capabilities
- Modified all user stories, requirements, and success criteria for robotics domain
- Updated assumptions and out-of-scope items with robotics-specific considerations
- Maintained original design structure (hero, cards, maturity levels, transformation section, footer)

## Next Steps

The specification is ready for the next phase. You may proceed with:
- `/sp.clarify` - If you want to identify any additional clarification questions
- `/sp.plan` - To create the architectural plan and implementation approach
