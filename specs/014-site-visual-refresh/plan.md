# Implementation Plan: Site Visual Refresh

**Branch**: `014-site-visual-refresh` | **Date**: 2025-12-06 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/014-site-visual-refresh/spec.md`

## Summary

This plan outlines the implementation of a site-wide visual refresh. This includes updating the logo and hero image, improving navigation links in the hero section and footer, and enhancing the aesthetic of the footer and sidebar to improve brand identity and user experience.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript, CSS, MDX
**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus, React
**Storage**: N/A
**Testing**: Playwright (for E2E visual checks)
**Target Platform**: Web (all modern browsers)
**Project Type**: Web application (Docusaurus site)
**Performance Goals**: No measurable impact on site performance.
**Constraints**: Changes should primarily be implemented via CSS and Docusaurus configuration to ensure maintainability.
**Scale/Scope**: Site-wide visual updates.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **Clarity**: The spec is clear and the requirements are well-defined.
- **Simplicity**: The approach uses standard Docusaurus features, component styling, and CSS, which is a simple and maintainable solution.
- **Testability**: The changes can be verified with visual inspection and E2E tests.

*Verdict*: The plan is aligned with the project constitution.

```

**Structure Decision**: The changes will be focused on modifying existing Docusaurus components and styles. This is a standard approach for themeing and content updates in a Docusaurus project.
