# Research for Module 3 - The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

Based on the feature specification (`specs/006-module3-ai-robot-brain/spec.md`) and the implementation plan (`specs/006-module3-ai-robot-brain/plan.md`), no specific technical research is required for *this phase* of content generation for Module 3.

The "Open Questions" identified in the feature specification are primarily pedagogical, content-related, or support-related, and do not present technical unknowns that block the creation of the educational content itself. These will be addressed in subsequent planning or content development stages.

The "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" markers in the `plan.md` related to performance goals (Docusaurus build time, page load time) pertain to the Docusaurus platform's overall performance, rather than specific technical challenges for generating Module 3's content. While important, these are outside the scope of *this* planning phase for content creation.
