# Feature Specification: Docusaurus Sidebar and Introduction Update

**Feature Branch**: `008-sidebar-intro-update`
**Created**: 2025-12-05
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Update the Docusaurus sidebar by removing all default items, including the tutorial introduction, core modules, and the application menu, ensuring that only the book’s custom structure remains. Replace the placeholder introduction content with an accurate introductory section tailored specifically for the “Teaching Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course” book. Reorganize the sidebar so that each module’s chapters are grouped under the correct module heading—for example, “Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)” containing its subtopics suchs as “Focus: Middleware for robot control” and “ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services.” The final sidebar must be clean, hierarchical, aligned with the book’s structure, and ready for content integration."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Clean and Structured Sidebar for Book Navigation (Priority: P1)

As a reader, I want the Docusaurus sidebar to only display the course book's custom structure, with modules and their chapters clearly organized under appropriate headings, so that I can easily navigate through the book's content without distractions from default or irrelevant items.

**Why this priority**: A clean and intuitive navigation is critical for a good user experience and accessibility of the book content. It directly impacts how readers engage with the material.

**Independent Test**: The Docusaurus site can be launched, and the sidebar can be visually inspected to ensure only the desired book structure is present and organized hierarchically.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the Docusaurus site is running, **When** I view the sidebar, **Then** all default tutorial items, core modules, and application menus should be absent.
2. **Given** the Docusaurus site is running, **When** I view the sidebar, **Then** "Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)" should be visible as a top-level heading.
3. **Given** I expand "Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)" in the sidebar, **When** I view its contents, **Then** subtopics like "Focus: Middleware for robot control" and "ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services" should be correctly listed as chapters underneath.
4. **Given** a new module (e.g., Module 2, 3, or 4) is added, **When** its content is configured correctly, **Then** it should appear hierarchically under its module heading in the sidebar.

### User Story 2 - Accurate and Tailored Introductory Content (Priority: P1)

As a new reader, I want to see an accurate and engaging introductory section specifically for the “Teaching Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course” book, including a high-level course outline, author introductions, and prerequisites, so that I can quickly understand the book's purpose, scope, and what I will learn.

**Why this priority**: The introduction is the first impression for new readers and is crucial for setting expectations and attracting engagement.

**Independent Test**: The Docusaurus site can be launched, and the introductory page content can be reviewed for accuracy, relevance, and completeness regarding the book's purpose, course outline, author introductions, and prerequisites.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the Docusaurus site is launched, **When** I navigate to the introductory page (e.g., home page or a dedicated "Introduction" chapter), **Then** the content should clearly state it is for "Teaching Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course" and include a high-level course outline, author introductions, and prerequisites.
2. **Given** I read the introductory content, **When** I finish, **Then** I should have a clear understanding of the book's target audience, main topics covered, overall learning journey, author credentials, and necessary foundational knowledge.

### Edge Cases

- What if a module or chapter lacks proper configuration (`_category_.json` or frontmatter), causing it not to appear in the sidebar or to appear incorrectly?
- How will images and multimedia content in the introductory section be handled to ensure consistent styling and loading performance?
- What happens if a future Docusaurus update changes how sidebars are configured, potentially breaking the custom structure?

## Assumptions

- The Docusaurus project's `sidebars.ts` file is the primary configuration point for the navigation sidebar, utilizing the built-in "autogenerated sidebar" feature.
- Existing module chapters (Module 1, Module 2, etc.) already have `_category_.json` files and chapter frontmatter that correctly define their `id`, `title`, and `sidebar_position`.
- The custom MDX components are already correctly implemented and available for use in the introductory content.
- Changes to the sidebar and introductory content will not negatively impact other non-book-related Docusaurus pages (if any exist).

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-12-05

- Q: What specific content should be included in the new introductory section? Should it include a high-level course outline, author introductions, or prerequisites for the entire course? → A: A high-level course outline, author introductions, and prerequisites for the entire course.
- Q: Should the introductory content be a standalone MDX page, or should it be integrated directly into the `index.tsx` or a similar home page component? → A: Standalone MDX page (`docs/intro.md`) presented as the first item in the sidebar, which can also be rendered on the homepage.
- Q: Are there any existing Docusaurus features or plugins that could automate or simplify the maintenance of the hierarchical sidebar structure, especially as new modules/chapters are added? → A: Utilize Docusaurus's built-in "autogenerated sidebar" feature for each category, requiring configuration of `_category_.json` files.

## Open Questions

- **OQ-001**: What specific content should be included in the new introductory section? Should it include a high-level course outline, author introductions, or prerequisites for the entire course?
- **OQ-003**: Should the introductory content be a standalone MDX page, or should it be integrated directly into the `index.tsx` or a similar home page component?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The Docusaurus sidebar MUST be updated to remove all default/placeholder navigation items.
- **FR-002**: The sidebar MUST display only the book's custom structure, starting with a standalone introductory MDX page (`docs/intro.md`) followed by module headings.
- **FR-003**: Each module's chapters MUST be grouped hierarchically under its respective module heading in the sidebar, utilizing the "autogenerated sidebar" feature through `_category_.json` files.
- **FR-004**: The content of the main introductory section MUST be replaced with accurate and relevant information for the "Teaching Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course", including a high-level course outline, author introductions, and prerequisites for the entire course.
- **FR-005**: The introductory content MUST clearly state the book's purpose, scope, learning objectives, author credentials, and necessary foundational knowledge.
- **FR-006**: The final sidebar MUST be clean, hierarchical, and aligned with the book's pedagogical structure.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

-   **Sidebar**: The Docusaurus navigation component (`sidebars.ts`).
-   **Module Heading**: A category in the sidebar representing a main learning module (e.g., "Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)").
-   **Chapter**: An individual learning document under a module.
-   **Introductory Content**: A standalone MDX page (`docs/intro.md`) that serves as the primary welcome/overview section of the book, presented as the first item in the sidebar, and capable of being rendered on the homepage.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

-   **SC-001**: The Docusaurus site builds successfully without navigation errors after the sidebar update.
-   **SC-002**: A visual inspection confirms that the sidebar contains only the book's custom hierarchical structure and no default Docusaurus navigation items.
-   **SC-003**: All module headings and their respective chapters are correctly displayed and nested in the sidebar as per the book's structure.
-   **SC-004**: The introductory content is reviewed and approved by stakeholders for accuracy, relevance, and completeness, with 100% alignment to the course description.
-   **SC-005**: User testing (e.g., 5 new users) demonstrates that readers can intuitively navigate the book using the updated sidebar to find specific chapters or modules.
