# Research for Docusaurus Sidebar and Introduction Update

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

Based on the feature specification (`specs/008-sidebar-intro-update/spec.md`) and the implementation plan (`specs/008-sidebar-intro-update/plan.md`), no specific technical research is required for *this phase* of the sidebar and introductory content update.

The "Open Questions" identified in the feature specification have been addressed and clarified during the `/sp.clarify` phase. The implementation approach (utilizing Docusaurus's built-in "autogenerated sidebar" feature and an MDX page for the introduction) is clearly defined.

The "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" markers in the `plan.md` related to performance goals (Docusaurus build time, page load time) pertain to the Docusaurus platform's overall performance, rather than specific technical challenges for this feature implementation. While important, these are outside the scope of *this* planning phase for the sidebar and introduction update.
