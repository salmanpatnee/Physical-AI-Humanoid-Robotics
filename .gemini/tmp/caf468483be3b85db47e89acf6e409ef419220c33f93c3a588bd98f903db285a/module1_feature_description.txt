We will write now the module 1, Module 1 will introduce readers to the “robotic nervous system” by building a practical and conceptual foundation in ROS 2, written using Docusaurus MDX with consistent learning components. This module will define the core communication architecture of modern humanoids by explaining ROS 2 nodes, topics, services, and message flow through real examples, and demonstrate how Python-based intelligent agents interface with robot controllers using rclpy. It will teach students how ROS 2 enables modular behaviors, how to structure distributed control across subsystems, and how agents can publish sensor data, subscribe to actuator commands, and invoke services for decision-making. The chapter will also introduce URDF as a machine-readable anatomy model for humanoid robots, showing how joints, links, sensors, and coordinate frames are described and visualized in tools like RViz. All chapters will use the textbook’s custom MDX components—<LearningObjectives />, <KeyTakeaways />, <Prerequisites />, and <ExerciseBlock />—and include frontmatter metadata validated against the project’s JSON Schema during Docusaurus build. Module output includes clear conceptual explanations, diagrams rendered with MDX, runnable ROS 2/Python examples, and structured exercises with progressive hints to demonstrate how software agents interact with humanoid robotic systems. Module 1 heading will be The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) and topics or chapters are 1 - Focus: Middleware for robot control. 2 - ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services. 3 - Bridging Python Agents to ROS controllers using rclpy. 4 - Understanding URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) for humanoids. check the attached pdf content material for more info @doc\Hackathon I_ Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook.pdf
