I want you to rewrite all content so that even a 5-year-old can understand the concepts clearly, using simple language, relatable examples, and child-friendly explanations. For every chapter, create a "What You Will Learn" section that summarizes the key ideas in a friendly and easy-to-read way. For every lesson inside the chapter, generate "Doubtful Questions and Answers" — common confusion points written as simple questions, followed by clear, straightforward answers that remove any misunderstanding. The final output should be simple, clean, engaging, and as easy to understand as drinking water, while still keeping the core meaning accurate.
