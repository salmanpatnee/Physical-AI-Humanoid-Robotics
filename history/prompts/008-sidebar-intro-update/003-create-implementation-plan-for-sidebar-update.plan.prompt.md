## Prompt

/sp.plan use the documentation of docusaurus: https://docusaurus.io/docs/, you can use context7 mcp for that

## Response snapshot

I have created the implementation plan for the "Docusaurus Sidebar and Introduction Update" feature.
The implementation plan is located at `specs/008-sidebar-intro-update/plan.md`.
The following artifacts have been generated:
- `specs/008-sidebar-intro-update/research.md`
- `specs/008-sidebar-intro-update/data-model.md`
- `specs/008-sidebar-intro-update/quickstart.md`
- `GEMINI.md` has been updated with relevant context.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created a comprehensive implementation plan for the Docusaurus sidebar and introduction update, including data model and quickstart guide.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files:
  - `specs/008-sidebar-intro-update/plan.md`
  - `specs/008-sidebar-intro-update/research.md`
  - `specs/008-sidebar-intro-update/data-model.md`
  - `specs/008-sidebar-intro-update/quickstart.md`
  - `GEMINI.md`
  - `history/prompts/008-sidebar-intro-update/003-create-implementation-plan-for-sidebar-update.plan.prompt.md`
- 🔁 Next prompts: Continue with `/sp.tasks` to define testable tasks.
- 🧠 Reflection: The planning process successfully incorporated the clarifications from the previous step and provided a structured approach for the implementation. The documentation link provided by the user would be useful for the implementation phase, but the plan itself focuses on the high-level structure.
