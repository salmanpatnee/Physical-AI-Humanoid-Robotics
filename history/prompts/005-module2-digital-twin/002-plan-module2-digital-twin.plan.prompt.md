## Prompt

/sp.plan This plan details the technical approach for creating the five MDX chapters of Module 2, The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity). The content will be integrated into the existing Docusaurus 3.x site, reusing the established MDX component system (LearningObjectives, ExerciseBlock, etc.) and metadata schema. The focus is on generating the educational content, including theory, guided exercises, Module 2 simulation examples in Gazebo and Unity, and assessments designed for learners with AI/ML backgrounds but limited robotics or simulation experience.

## Response snapshot

Created the implementation plan, research document, data model, and quickstart guide for Module 2.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created a technical plan for 'Module 2 - The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)'.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: 
  - `specs/005-module2-digital-twin/plan.md`
  - `specs/005-module2-digital-twin/research.md`
  - `specs/005-module2-digital-twin/data-model.md`
  - `specs/005-module2-digital-twin/quickstart.md`
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: The planning phase was straightforward as it primarily involves content creation within an existing project structure.
